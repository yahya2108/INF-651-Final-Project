Random Fun Fact Generator - Project Documentation

Introduction
The Random Fun Fact Generator is a web application that provides users with random fun facts
from different categories, including Science, Animals, and History. The purpose of this app is to offer
an interactive and entertaining experience by presenting users with interesting facts. Users can also
save their favorite facts and view them later on a separate page.

Features
1. Home Page: The home page welcomes users and includes a 'Get Started' button. Upon clicking,
users are directed to the Fun Fact Page.
2. Fun Fact Page: Users can select a category (Science, Animals, History), generate a random fact,
and view it. They can also save the fact to their favorites or surprise themselves with a random fact.
3. Favorites Page: Users can view all their saved favorite facts, remove them if desired, or clear the
entire list.

Technical Details
The application uses JavaScript to handle various functionalities:
1. DOM Manipulation: The app uses DOM manipulation to update the content of the webpage based
on user interactions, such as displaying facts and navigating between pages.
2. Event Handling: JavaScript event listeners are used to capture user interactions, like clicking
buttons to generate facts or save favorites.
3. Local Storage: The app saves user favorites using localStorage so that the list persists across
page reloads.
4. Conditional Logic: The app randomly selects facts based on the chosen category or surprises the
user by picking a random category.

Challenges & Solutions
During the development of this project, I faced several challenges:
1. Ensuring that the favorites list persisted even after the page was refreshed. I solved this by using
the localStorage API to store and retrieve the user's saved facts.
2. Implementing the navigation between pages. Initially, I wanted to display all pages at once, but
later switched to a tab-based approach for smoother navigation.
3. Formatting the fun fact display. I used CSS to ensure the facts were readable and visually
appealing by adding padding, background colors, and box shadows.

Future Plans
In the future, I plan to enhance the application by adding the following features:
1. API Integration: To provide real-time facts, I could integrate an API that offers a constantly
updating list of fun facts.
2. Keyword Search: Users would be able to search for facts based on specific keywords, making the
app more interactive and user-friendly.
3. More Categories: Additional categories such as Technology, Space, or Geography could be
added to broaden the variety of facts available to users.
